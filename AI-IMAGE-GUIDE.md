## üîß Customization Options

### Image Dimensions
Modify the `size` parameter in the AI service calls:
- Hero: 1920x1080 or 2048x1024
- Projects: 1024x768 or 1200x900
- Blog: 1024x512 or 1200x600
- Team: 512x512 or 600x600

### Style Variations
Add style modifiers to prompts:
- `photorealistic, highly detailed`
- `architectural photography, professional lighting`
- `modern minimalist design`
- `curved architectural elements`
- `natural light, soft shadows`

### Quality Settings
- **Standard**: Good quality, faster generation
- **HD**: Higher quality, slower generation
- **4K**: Maximum quality, longest generation time

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Batch Generation
```python
# Generate specific image types
generator = AIImageGenerator()

# Generate only hero image
hero_result = generator.generate_hero_image("openai")

# Generate only project images
project_results = generator.generate_project_images("stability")

# Generate only blog images
blog_results = generator.generate_blog_images("replicate")
```

### Custom Prompts
```python
# Use custom prompts for specific needs
custom_prompt = """
Modern office building with curved glass facade,
architectural photography, professional lighting,
corporate environment, modern workspace design,
high resolution, professional quality
"""

result = generator.generate_with_openai(custom_prompt, "custom-image.jpg", "images/projects/")
```

### Multiple Services
```python
# Generate with multiple services and choose the best
services = ["openai", "stability", "replicate"]
results = {}

for service in services:
    results[service] = generator.generate_hero_image(service)
```

## üìä Quality Control

### Image Validation
- Check resolution and aspect ratio
- Verify color accuracy and lighting
- Ensure architectural elements are clear
- Confirm professional quality standards

### Optimization
- Compress images for web use (JPEG quality 85-90%)
- Create multiple sizes for responsive design
- Add alt text for accessibility
- Optimize loading speed

### Backup Strategy
- Keep original high-resolution images
- Create multiple variations for A/B testing
- Store prompts and settings for regeneration
- Maintain version control for image updates

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### Budget Planning
- **OpenAI DALL-E**: ~$0.04 per image (15 images = ~$0.60)
- **Stability AI**: ~$0.02 per image (15 images = ~$0.30)
- **Replicate**: ~$0.01-0.03 per image (15 images = ~$0.15-0.45)

### Cost-Saving Tips
- Use standard quality for initial testing
- Generate multiple variations in one session
- Reuse successful prompts for similar images
- Consider bulk generation for better rates

## üîÑ Integration with Website

### Update Image References
After generating images, update the website files:

1. **HTML**: Update image src attributes
2. **CSS**: Adjust background-image properties
3. **JavaScript**: Update image paths in galleries
4. **JSON**: Update data files with new image paths

### Responsive Images
Create multiple sizes for responsive design:
- Desktop: 1920x1080 (hero), 800x600 (projects)
- Tablet: 1024x768 (hero), 600x450 (projects)
- Mobile: 768x432 (hero), 400x300 (projects)

## üéØ Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
- Be specific about architectural style
- Include lighting and mood requirements
- Specify image composition and framing
- Mention professional quality standards

### Quality Assurance
- Review each generated image
- Ensure consistency across the set
- Check for architectural accuracy
- Verify brand alignment

### Performance Optimization
- Compress images appropriately
- Use lazy loading for galleries
- Implement progressive loading
- Cache images for faster loading

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Errors**: Verify API keys are set correctly
2. **Rate Limits**: Implement delays between requests
3. **Quality Issues**: Adjust prompts or try different services
4. **Size Problems**: Check image dimensions and aspect ratios

### Debugging
```python
# Enable debug mode
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Check API key status
print(f"OpenAI API Key: {'Set' if os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') else 'Not Set'}")
print(f"Stability API Key: {'Set' if os.getenv('STABILITY_API_KEY') else 'Not Set'}")
print(f"Replicate API Key: {'Set' if os.getenv('REPLICATE_API_KEY') else 'Not Set'}")
```
